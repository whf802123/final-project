## Project Title: 
DialogSystem 

## Project description: 
The dialog system allows players to interact with non-playable characters (NPCs) and make decisions that affect the game's storyline. This project aims to develop a game dialog system that can improve the player's experience by creating engaging and dynamic conversations with NPCs. 

##JSP files and Servlet (the features and methods in your project) 
I would create a xml dataset to store all dialogs, and questions.js which can provide players questions. Depending on the player's different choices, the plot direction will also vary, and ultimately there will be multiple endings.
