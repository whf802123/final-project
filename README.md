## Project Title: 
DialogSystem 

## Project description: 
The dialog system allows players to interact with non-playable characters (NPCs) and make decisions that affect the game's storyline. This project aims to develop a game dialog system that can improve the player's experience by creating engaging and dynamic conversations with NPCs. 

##JSP files and Servlet (the features and methods in your project) 
I would create a xml dataset to store all dialogs, and questions.js which can provide players questions. Depending on the player's different choices, the plot direction will also vary, and ultimately there will be multiple endings. 

My project is a choice oriented storyline game, different choices will lead to different branch plots and ultimately lead to different endings. The entire project will be implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The text data will be saved in XML file format, and the images used in the project will be generated by Midjourney. This is a web game that players only need to click to operate, and it will be background music, allowing players to choose to pause. This is a single person project, and I will be responsible for all work, including development and testing.
